# This repository is incomplete on its own

Dowload handwritten data [here from the HWDB repository](https://github.com/AND-Q/HWDB1.1-). Either trn or tst are fine. (I believe I just used tst)

Get all packs listed in requirements.txt - but replace PyTorch and nvidia-specific packs to suit your envirounment.

Also you'll need to change all dirctories starting with "/mnt/data" to your project's directory.

Be sure to have the fonts needed to generate printed images, or replace them with your own fonts (that support Chinese characters).
